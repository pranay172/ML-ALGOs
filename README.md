# ML-ALGOs
SELF-PROJECT

This Repository consists of Project exercises and Capstone projects of various ML Algorithms completed by me from the course on Udemy(2021 Python for Machine Learning & Data Science Masterclass) https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-machine-learning-data-science-masterclass/

Applied Supervised algorithms like KNNs, SVMs, Random Forests, Boosting Methods, Naive Bayes Classification and Unsupervised algorithms like K-Means Clustering, PCA on different datasets.Implemented all algorithms using python scikit-learn library and hyperparameters are tuned using Grid Search Cross Validation and the best for the particular dataset are found. This was done as a part of learning the algorithms through project exercises.
