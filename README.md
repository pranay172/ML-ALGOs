# ML-ALGOs
SELF-PROJECT

This Repository consists of Project exercises and Capstone projects of various ML Algorithms completed by me from the course on Udemy(2021 Python for Machine Learning & Data Science Masterclass) https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-machine-learning-data-science-masterclass/
The Algorithms include KNNs, SVMs, Random Forests, Boosting Methods, K-Means Clustering, PCA. All the algorithms are developed in python using scikit-learn library.
